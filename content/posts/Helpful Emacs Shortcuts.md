- `describe-bindings` or `SPC h b b` is super helpful for knowing what happens
  when you press stuff
- `SPC h` is for help related stuff, same as `C-h`
- `C-h k` or `SPC h k` or `describe-key` will give information about keys you
  press when it prompts you.
- All `describe-*` is super helpful. There's `describe-variable`,
  `describe-command`, `describe-function` and so on.
- `C-M-h` -> mark-defun will select a whole function
- `C-M-SPC` -> `mark-sexp` will select the next ast node(sort of), repeating it
  more will move forward. `C-M-<left>` will move backward

Hi I am Dipesh, I am a first year PhD Student in School of Computing @ NUS. I used to work as a software developer (primarily backend) before this.

I am interested in Systems Programming, Programming Languages and Formal Methods. I have experience writing code in multiple languages C++ and Rust in my hobby projects, Java and Typescript as a Software Engineer, and OCaml as hobby and as an intern. I'm also trying to blog about things that I learn nowadays. Lately, I've been working with Lean and trying to gain expertise in it.

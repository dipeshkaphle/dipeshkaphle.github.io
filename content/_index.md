Hi I am Dipesh, I am an aspiring Software Engineer. Among many things,
I enjoy programming, mainly using C++, Rust and a bit of OCaml and Python thrown
into the mix. As such, that's where my primary wealth of experience is.
In CS, My interests primarily lie in Compilers and Operating Systems because
I love how complicated they are. I've been exploring more about Compilers,
Memory Management and Concurrency nowadays.

On the side, I tend to watch a lot of movies and shows, ocassionally fall into the
YouTube rabbit hole and learn more about programming languages for fun.

You can find my projects [here](/projects/). You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ARzKGlkeKKrMm_oS9OddW4eOcreHDS39/view?usp=sharing)
